            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2020 by Dr. Sarah Jones and a team of passionate volunteers, Paws & Claws Wildlife Rescue was born from a critical need to provide specialized care for the Western Cape's vulnerable indigenous wildlife. What began as a small backyard operation has grown into a recognized rehabilitation center that has helped hundreds of animals return to their natural habitats.</p>
