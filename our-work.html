                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Assess the Situation</h3>
                    <p>Keep a safe distance. Do not approach dangerous animals like baboons, snakes, or large carnivores. Observe from a distance to determine if the animal is truly injured or just resting.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Keep the Animal Calm</h3>
                    <p>Keep noise to a minimum and avoid sudden movements. Keep children and pets away from the area. Do not attempt to feed the animal.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Contact Us Immediately</h3>
                    <p>Call our emergency hotline: <strong>081 234 5678</strong>. Be ready to provide:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your exact location</li>
                        <li>Type of animal (if known)</li>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Secure the Area (If Safe)</h3>
                    <p>If it's safe to do so, you can prevent the animal from wandering into traffic by creating a gentle barrier. Never put yourself in danger.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">

                <ul>
                    <li>Do not attempt to handle the animal yourself</li>
                    <li>Never give food or water to injured wildlife</li>
                    <li>Keep the animal in a quiet, dark place if you must contain it temporarily</li>
